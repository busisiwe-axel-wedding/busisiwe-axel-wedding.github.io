     FAQs
Dates and locations
The festivities start in Pretoria.

Friday 13th of February: get to know each other party at 3PM, location to be decided.

Saturday 14th of February: traditional African wedding! Starts at 10AM, location to be decided.

Travel to Cape Town.

Tuesday 17th of February: beach day! Meet at 12PM on Camps Bay beach. Bring your own food and snacks, there are several shops conveniently located right next to the beach, like Pick n Pay and Woolies.

Wednesday 18th of February: sightseeing! Axel will lead a road trip: Cape Town – Chapman’s Peak Drive – Simon’s Town – Muizenberg, with lunch someplace along the way. If people are up for it, we can continue along Baden-Powell Drive, Clarence Drive, Franschhoek, Stellenbosch, before taking the N2 back to Cape Town. This covers some incredibly beautiful coastal roads. This is an extremely enjoyable drive, that can be done on a scooter, motorbike or in a car.

Busisiwe will do a walk-about, starting at our home in the historical Bo-Kaap district, we will meander into the central business district (CBD), Woodstock and Salt River. Vibrant murals and heritage sites are awaiting.

Friday 20th of February: get to know each other party, at Time Out Market, V&A Waterfront, at 3PM. This is a massive food hall with plenty of different food and drink offerings. Perfect mingle setting, as there is no table service – everyone will have to walk around, bumping into each other. Fantastic outdoor seating with the view of Table Mountain.

Saturday 21st of February: European wedding! Venue: Rooftop on Bree. You are welcome from 2PM, ceremony starts at 3PM.

Flights
To get to Pretoria, book a flight to Johannesburg (OR Tambo International Airport). Pretoria is a 30 minute Uber ride away. To book international flights to Johannesburg and Cape Town, Google Flights is a great place to start. To fly domestic between Johannesburg and Cape Town, FlySafair is recommended. 

Accommodation
For people planning to come to Pretoria, getting an AirBnB in Hazelwood is recommended, which is a very beautiful, safe, residential area. That is also where the party on Friday the 13th will happen (hopefully with not too much bad luck). Pretoria is one of the three capitals of South Africa, rich with history, which you can experience at the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park.

In Cape Town, the recommended areas to book accommodation, in descending order, is the V&A Waterfront, De Waterkant, Green Point and Sea Point (V&A Waterfront being the most expensive). These areas are safe, walkable, and close to the legendary Sea Point Promenade. If you want the full-on beach holiday experience, stay in Camps Bay.

Getting around
Uber works really well, everywhere. Make sure to install the app and load your credit card. There is no reason to rent a car in Pretoria or Cape Town, as everything is easily accessible with Uber. If you want to rent for the road trip (or are planning to venture further in this amazing country), there are plenty of options in the centre of Cape Town. Two wheels: Vespa, Triumph, BMW, Harley-Davidson. Car: SANI, Europcar, AVIS.

Mobile data
It is highly recommended to have mobile data, as WhatsApp, Messenger, Uber and Google Maps will be very useful to have on your phone. Either use an e-sim app to load up data before you land (like Airalo) or get a SIM card with data when you land at the airport. MTN or Vodacom will both be fine.

Food and drinks
It is perfectly safe to drink tap water. The restaurant scene in both Pretoria and Cape Town is world class, as are the South African wines. Cape Town has a large variety of art galleries and shopping opportunities, in addition to hiking and beach vibes. Time Out voted Cape Town best city in the world 2025!

Safety
South Africa has a bad reputation for crime, but we will not go to the risky areas. All the places recommended above are safe to walk around during daylight. At night, it is best to take an Uber, unless you know exactly where you’re going.

Gift registry
We don’t want any wedding gifts, your presence is the present!
