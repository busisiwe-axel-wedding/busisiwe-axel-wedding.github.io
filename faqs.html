      <h2>Flights</h2>
      To get to Pretoria, book a flight to Johannesburg (OR Tambo International Airport). Pretoria is a 30-40 minute Uber ride away. To book international flights to Johannesburg and Cape Town, <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights">Google Flights</a> is a great place to start. To fly domestic between Johannesburg and Cape Town, <a href="https://www.flysafair.co.za/">FlySafair</a> is recommended.

      <h2>Accommodation</h2>
      For people planning to come to Pretoria, getting an AirBnB in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pcRKTHGK5ppP8J8g6">Hazelwood</a> is recommended, which is a very beautiful, safe, residential area. Pretoria is one of the three capitals of South Africa, rich with history, which you can experience at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2U4Uyy8FYtYwD9Pz5">Voortrekker Monument</a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FqXGxyvGczHuGf7D9">Freedom Park</a>. This map highlights some areas to stay in.

      <p/>
      In Cape Town, the recommended areas to book accommodation, in descending order, are the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bqt8mowKeHU7XPDZ6">V&A Waterfront</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BeJ8LPJ8CNEvT7hZA">De Waterkant</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GkJRVgm63d1RyfM26">Green Point</a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/haUmAeh4NYnZQajQ8">Sea Point</a> (V&A Waterfront being the most expensive). These areas are safe, walkable, and close to the legendary Sea Point Promenade. If you want the full-on beach holiday experience, stay in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RQTyTGqSVL3kRUnQ7">Camps Bay</a>.
      <h2>Getting around</h2>
      Uber works really well, everywhere. Make sure to install the app and load your credit card. There is no reason to rent a car in Pretoria or Cape Town, as everything is easily accessible with Uber. If you want to rent a vehicle for the road trip (or are planning to venture further in this amazing country), there are plenty of options in the centre of Cape Town. Two wheels: <a href="https://capetownvesparentals.com/">Vespa</a>, <a href="https://www.triumphmotorcycles.co.za/triumph-cape-town">Triumph</a>, <a href="https://www.bmw-motorrad.co.za/cape-town/en/home.html#/section-current-offers">BMW</a>, <a href="https://www.gsafrica.com">GS Africa</a> (BMW, Honda, Harley Davidson, Ducati, KTM, Yamaha). Car: <a href="https://sani.co.za/car-rental-locations/western-cape/">SANI</a>, <a href="https://www.europcar.co.za/rental-locations/rsa/western-cape/cape-town-city-waterfront">Europcar</a>, <a href="https://www.avis.co.za/drive-avis/car-hire-locations/africa/south-africa/cape-town/cape-town-car-hire">AVIS</a>.
      <h2>Mobile data</h2>
      It is highly recommended to have mobile data, as WhatsApp, Messenger, Uber and Google Maps will be very useful to access on your phone. Either use an e-sim app to load up data before you land (like <a href="https://www.airalo.com/">Airalo</a>) or get a SIM card with data when you land at the airport. <a href="https://www.mtn.co.za/home/">MTN</a> or <a href="https://www.vodacom.co.za/">Vodacom</a> will both be fine.
      <h2>Food and drinks</h2>
      It is perfectly safe to drink tap water. The restaurant scene in both Pretoria and Cape Town is world class, as are the South African wines. Cape Town has a large variety of art galleries and shopping opportunities, in addition to hiking and beach vibes. Time Out voted <a href="https://www.timeout.com/things-to-do/best-cities-in-the-world">Cape Town best city in the world 2025</a>!
      <h2>Safety</h2>
      South Africa has a bad reputation for crime, but we will not go to the risky areas. All the places recommended above are safe to walk around during daylight. At night, it is best to take an Uber, unless you know exactly where you’re going.
      <h2>Gift registry</h2>
      We don’t want any wedding gifts, your presence is the present!
